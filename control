Description: make linux programs reproducible on all linux systems
 CARE monitors the execution of the specified command to create an archive that
 contains all the material required to re-execute it in the same context.
 .
 That way, the command will be reproducible everywhere, even on Linux systems
 that are supposed to be not compatible with the original Linux system. CARE is
 typically useful to get reliable bug reports, demonstrations, artifact
 evaluation, tutorials, portable applications, minimal rootfs, file-system
 coverage, ...
 .
 By design, CARE does not record events at all. Instead, it archives
 environment variables and accessed file-system components -- before
 modification -- during the so-called initial execution. Then, to reproduce
 this execution, the re-execute.sh script embedded into the archive restores
 the environment variables and relaunches the command confined into the saved
 file-system.
