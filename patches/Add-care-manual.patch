+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.sp
+\fBcare\fP [\fIoption\fP] ... \fIcommand\fP
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.sp
+CARE monitors the execution of the specified command to create an
+\fIarchive\fP that contains all the material required to \fIre\-execute\fP it
+in the same context.  That way, the command will be reproducible
+everywhere, even on Linux systems that are supposed to be not
+compatible with the original Linux system.  CARE is typically useful
+to get reliable bug reports, demonstrations, \fI\%artifact evaluation\fP,
+tutorials, portable applications, minimal rootfs, file\-system
+coverage, ...
+.sp
+By design, CARE does not record events at all.  Instead, it archives
+environment variables and accessed file\-system components \-\- before
+modification \-\- during the so\-called \fIinitial\fP execution.  Then, to
+reproduce this execution, the \fBre\-execute.sh\fP script embedded into
+the archive restores the environment variables and relaunches the
+command confined into the saved file\-system.  That way, both \fIinitial\fP
+and \fIreproduced\fP executions should produce the same results as they
+use the same context, assuming they do not rely on external events \-\-
+like key strokes or network packets \-\- or that these external events
+are replayed manually or automatically, using \fI\%umockdev\fP for instance.
+That means it is possible to alter explicitly the reproduced
+executions by changing content of the saved file\-system, or by
+replaying different external events.
+.SS Privacy
+.sp
+To ensure that no sensitive file can possibly leak into the archive,
+CARE \fIconceals\fP recursively the content of \fB$HOME\fP and \fB/tmp\fP,
+that is, they appear empty during the original execution.  Although,
+for consistency reasons, the content of \fB$PWD\fP is \fIrevealed\fP even if
+it is nested into the two previous paths.
+.sp
+As a consequence, a program executed under CARE may behave
+unexpectedly because a required path is not accessible anymore.  In
+this case, such a path has to be revealed explicitly.  For details,
+see the options \fB\-\-concealed\-path\fP and \fB\-\-revealed\-path\fP, and the
+file \fBconcealed\-accesses.txt\fP as well.
+.sp
+It is advised to inspect the archived content before sharing it.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.sp
+The command\-line interface is composed of two parts: first CARE\(aqs
+options, then the command to launch.  This section describes the
+options supported by CARE, that is, the first part of its command\-line
+interface.
+.INDENT 0.0
+.TP
+.BI \-o \ path\fP,\fB \ \-\-output\fB= path
+Archive in \fIpath\fP, its suffix specifies the format.
+.sp
+The suffix of \fIpath\fP is used to select the archive format, it can
+be one of the following:
+.TS
+center;
+|l|l|.
+_
+T{
+suffix
+T}	T{
+comment
+T}
+_
+T{
+/
+T}	T{
+don\(aqt archive, copy into the specified directory instead
+T}
+_
+T{
+\&.tar
+T}	T{
+most common archive format
+T}
+_
+T{
+\&.cpio
+T}	T{
+most portable archive format, it can archive sockets too
+T}
+_
+T{
+?.gz
+T}	T{
+most common compression format, but slow
+T}
+_
+T{
+?.lzo
+T}	T{
+fast compression format, but uncommon
+T}
+_
+T{
+?.bin
+T}	T{
+see \fBSelf\-extracting format\fP section
+T}
+_
+T{
+?.?.bin
+T}	T{
+see \fBSelf\-extracting format\fP section
+T}
+_
+T{
+\&.bin
+T}	T{
+see \fBSelf\-extracting format\fP section
+T}
+_
+T{
+\&.raw
+T}	T{
+recommended archive format, use \fIcare \-x\fP to extract
+T}
+_
+.TE
+.sp
+where "?" means the suffix must be combined with another one.  For
+examples: ".tar.lzo", ".cpio.gz", ".tar.bin", ".cpio.lzo.bin", ...
+If this option is not specified, the default output path is
+\fBcare\-<DATE>.bin\fP or \fBcare\-<DATE>.raw\fP, depending on whether
+CARE was built with self\-extracting format support or not.
+.TP
+.BI \-c \ path\fP,\fB \ \-\-concealed\-path\fB= path
+Make \fIpath\fP content appear empty during the original execution.
+.sp
+Some paths may contain sensitive data that should never be
+archived.  This is typically the case for most of the files in:
+.INDENT 7.0
+.IP \(bu 2
+$HOME
+.IP \(bu 2
+/tmp
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+That\(aqs why these directories are recursively \fIconcealed\fP from the
+original execution, unless the \fB\-d\fP option is specified.
+Concealed paths appear empty during the original execution, as a
+consequence their original content can\(aqt be accessed nor archived.
+.TP
+.BI \-r \ path\fP,\fB \ \-\-revealed\-path\fB= path
+Make \fIpath\fP content accessible when nested in a concealed path.
+.sp
+Concealed paths might make the original execution with CARE behave
+differently from an execution without CARE.  For example, a lot of
+\fBNo such file or directory\fP errors might appear.  The solution
+is to \fIreveal\fP recursively any required paths that would be nested
+into a \fIconcealed\fP path.  Note that \fB$PWD\fP is \fIrevealed\fP, unless
+the \fB\-d\fP option is specified.
+.TP
+.BI \-p \ path\fP,\fB \ \-\-volatile\-path\fB= path
+Don\(aqt archive \fIpath\fP content, reuse actual \fIpath\fP instead.
+.sp
+Some paths contain only communication means with programs that
+can\(aqt be monitored by CARE, like the kernel or a remote server.
+Such paths are said \fIvolatile\fP; they shouldn\(aqt be archived,
+instead they must be accessed from the \fIactual\fP rootfs during the
+re\-execution.  This is typically the case for the following pseudo
+file\-systems, sockets, and authority files:
+.INDENT 7.0
+.IP \(bu 2
+/dev
+.IP \(bu 2
+/proc
+.IP \(bu 2
+/sys
+.IP \(bu 2
+/run/shm
+.IP \(bu 2
+/tmp/.X11\-unix
+.IP \(bu 2
+/tmp/.ICE\-unix
+.IP \(bu 2
+$XAUTHORITY
+.IP \(bu 2
+$ICEAUTHORITY
+.IP \(bu 2
+/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket
+.IP \(bu 2
+/var/tmp/kdecache\-$LOGNAME
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+This is also typically the case for any other fifos or sockets.
+These paths are considered \fIvolatile\fP, unless the \fB\-d\fP option is
+specified.
+.TP
+.BI \-e \ name\fP,\fB \ \-\-volatile\-env\fB= name
+Don\(aqt archive \fIname\fP env. variable, reuse actual value instead.
+.sp
+Some environment variables are used to communicate with programs
+that can\(aqt be monitored by CARE, like remote servers.  Such
+environment variables are said \fIvolatile\fP; they shouldn\(aqt be
+archived, instead they must be accessed from the \fIactual\fP
+environment during the re\-execution.  This is typically the case
+for the following ones:
+.INDENT 7.0
+.IP \(bu 2
+DISPLAY
+.IP \(bu 2
+http_proxy
+.IP \(bu 2
+https_proxy
+.IP \(bu 2
+ftp_proxy
+.IP \(bu 2
+all_proxy
+.IP \(bu 2
+HTTP_PROXY
+.IP \(bu 2
+HTTPS_PROXY
+.IP \(bu 2
+FTP_PROXY
+.IP \(bu 2
+ALL_PROXY
+.IP \(bu 2
+DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
+.IP \(bu 2
+SESSION_MANAGER
+.IP \(bu 2
+XDG_SESSION_COOKIE
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+These environment variables are considered \fIvolatile\fP, unless the
+\fB\-d\fP option is specified.
+.TP
+.BI \-m \ value\fP,\fB \ \-\-max\-archivable\-size\fB= value
+Set the maximum size of archivable files to \fIvalue\fP megabytes.
+.sp
+To keep the CPU time and the disk space used by the archiver
+reasonable, files whose size exceeds \fIvalue\fP megabytes are
+truncated down to 0 bytes.  The default is 1GB, unless the \fB\-d\fP
+option is specified.  A negative \fIvalue\fP means no limit.
+.TP
+.B \-d\fP,\fB  \-\-ignore\-default\-config
+Don\(aqt use the default options.
+.TP
+.BI \-x \ file\fP,\fB \ \-\-extract\fB= file
+Extract content of the archive \fIfile\fP, then exit.
+.sp
+It is recommended to use this option to extract archives created
+by CARE because most extracting tools \-\- that are not based on
+libarchive \-\- are too limited to extract them correctly.
+.TP
+.BI \-v \ value\fP,\fB \ \-\-verbose\fB= value
+Set the level of debug information to \fIvalue\fP\&.
+.sp
+The higher the integer \fIvalue\fP is, the more detailed debug
+information is printed to the standard error stream.  A negative
+\fIvalue\fP makes CARE quiet except on fatal errors.
+.TP
+.B \-V\fP,\fB  \-\-version\fP,\fB  \-\-about
+Print version, copyright, license and contact, then exit.
+.TP
+.B \-h\fP,\fB  \-\-help\fP,\fB  \-\-usage
+Print the user manual, then exit.
+.UNINDENT
+.SH EXIT STATUS
+.sp
+If an internal error occurs, \fBcare\fP returns a non\-zero exit status,
+otherwise it returns the exit status of the last terminated program.
+When an error has occurred, the only way to know if it comes from the
+last terminated program or from \fBcare\fP itself is to have a look at
+the error message.
+.SH FILES
+.sp
+The output archive contains the following files:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.TP
+.B \fBre\-execute.sh\fP
+start the re\-execution of the initial command as originally
+specified.  It is also possible to specify an alternate command.
+For example, assuming \fBgcc\fP was archived, it can be re\-invoked
+differently:
+.INDENT 7.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+$ ./re\-execute.sh gcc \-\-version
+gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.5.2\-8ubuntu4) 4.5.2
+.sp
+$ echo \(aqint main(void) { return puts("OK"); }\(aq > rootfs/foo.c
+$ ./re\-execute.sh gcc \-Wall /foo.c
+$ foo.c: In function "main":
+$ foo.c:1:1: warning: implicit declaration of function "puts"
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.TP
+.B \fBrootfs/\fP
+directory where all the files used during the original execution
+were archived, they will be required for the reproduced execution.
+.TP
+.B \fBproot\fP
+virtualization tool invoked by re\-execute.sh to confine the
+reproduced execution into the rootfs.  It also emulates the
+missing kernel features if needed.
+.TP
+.B \fBconcealed\-accesses.txt\fP
+list of accessed paths that were concealed during the original
+execution.  Its main purpose is to know what are the paths that
+should be revealed if the the original execution didn\(aqt go as
+expected.  It is absolutely useless for the reproduced execution.
+.UNINDENT
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+.sp
+It\(aqs not possible to use GDB, strace, or any programs based on
+\fIptrace\fP under CARE yet.  This latter is also based on this syscall,
+but the Linux kernel allows only one \fIptracer\fP per process.  This will
+be fixed in a future version of CARE thanks to a ptrace emulator.
+.SH EXAMPLE
+.sp
+In this example, Alice wants to report to Bob that the compilation of
+PRoot v2.4 raises an unexpected warning:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf
+.ft C
+alice$ make \-C PRoot\-2.4/src/

+[...]
+.ft P
+.fi
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+Technically, Alice uses Ubuntu 11.04 for x86, whereas Bob uses
+Slackware 13.37 on x86_64.  Both distros are supposed to be shipped
+with GCC 4.5.2, however Bob is not able to reproduce this issue on his
+system:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf

+.ft P

+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+Since they don\(aqt have much time to investigate this issue by iterating
+between each other, they decide to use CARE.  First, Alice prepends
+\fBcare\fP to her command:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf
+.ft C
+alice$ care make \-C PRoot\-2.4/src/

+.ft P
+.fi
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+Then she sends the \fBcare\-130213072430.bin\fP file to Bob.  Now, he
+should be able to reproduce her issue on his system:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf
+.ft C
+bob$ ./care\-130213072430.bin

+[...]
+.ft P
+.fi
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+So far so good!  This compiler warning doesn\(aqt make sense to Bob since
+\fBstrtol\fP is used there to check a string format; the return value is
+useless, only the \fBerrno\fP value matters.  Further investigations are
+required, so Bob re\-execute Alice\(aqs GCC differently to get more
+details:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5

+The same invocation on his system returns something slightly

+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+This confirms that both GCC versions are the same, however Alice\(aqs one
+seems to have been modified by Ubuntu.  Although, according to the web
+page related to this Ubuntu package [1], no changes regarding
+\fBstrtol\fP were made.  So Bob decides to search into the files coming
+from Alice\(aqs system, that is, the \fBrootfs\fP directory in the
+archive:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf
+.ft C

+[...]
+.ft P
+.fi
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+Here, the file \fBusr/include/stdlib.h\fP contains a declaration of
+\fBstrtol\fP with the "warn unused result" attribute.  On Ubuntu, this
+file belongs to the EGLIBC package, and its related web page [2]
+shows that this attribute was actually wrongly introduced by the
+official EGLIBC developers.  Ultimately Bob should notify them in this
+regard.
+.sp
+Thanks to CARE, Bob was able to reproduce the issue reported by Alice
+without effort.  For investigations purpose, he was able to re\-execute
+programs differently and to search into the relevant files.

+.SH SELF-EXTRACTING FORMAT
+.sp
+The self\-extracting format used by CARE starts with an extracting
+program, followed by a regular archive, and it ends with a special
+footer.  This latter contains the signature "I_LOVE_PIZZA" followed by
+the size of the embedded archive:

+.sp
+The command \fBcare \-x\fP can be used against a self\-extracting archive,
+even if they were not build for the same architecture.  For instance,
+a self\-extracting archive produced for ARM can be extracted with a
+\fBcare\fP program built for x86_64, and vice versa.  It is also
+possible to use external tools to extract the embedded archive, for
+example:
